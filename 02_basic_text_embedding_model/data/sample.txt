Artificial Intelligence enables machines to learn from data and make decisions.
In natural language processing, tokenization and embeddings allow models to understand context.
Word embeddings are dense representations of words in a continuous vector space.
They are the foundation for neural models that work with language, such as translation, summarization, and question answering.
