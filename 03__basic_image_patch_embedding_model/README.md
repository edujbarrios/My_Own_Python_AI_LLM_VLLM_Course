# Part 3 â€“ Image Patch Embeddings  
MY OWN PYTHON AI LLM-VLLM COURSE BY https://edujbarrios.com

This module implements a basic patch embedding model, simulating how modern vision architectures like ViT process images into patch vectors.

## Project Goals

- Load and normalize images
- Split images into patches
- Flatten and project patches into embedding vectors
- Fully configurable pipeline
