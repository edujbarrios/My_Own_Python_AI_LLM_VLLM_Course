# Part 1 â€“ Basic NLP Tokenizer  
MY OWN PYTHON AI LLM-VLLM COURSE BY https://edujbarrios.com

This project is the foundation of an applied AI course. It simulates how language models (LLMs) process text by implementing a basic, customizable tokenizer pipeline.

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand how raw text is preprocessed for NLP/LLMs
- Create a reusable and modular tokenizer class
- Build and manage vocabulary
- Encode and decode tokens using token IDs
- Parameterize the entire pipeline from a configuration file

---

## Folder Structure

- `tokenizer/`: Core logic
- `config/`: All system parameters
- `data/`: Input files
- `main.py`: Execution entry point
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency list
